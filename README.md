# Original README
This is a Breeze Dark Theme for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) based on the Breeze Dark theme made by the KDE Project.

The icons are from the default Nextcloud theme and the individual apps, with the colors changed to better fit the theme.

## Version number
The first number is the Nextcloud version. The second number is the Nextcloud major point release version. The third number is the theme version.

## Progress
Theming for Core Nextcloud functionality is done. You can check on the progress of App styling and request styling for specific apps [here](https://github.com/mwalbeck/nextcloud-breeze-dark/wiki/App-Styling)

## Installation
The master branch will always be the current stable release so you can clone that for easy installation and updates. Using git is currently the recommended way of installing the theme. You can also download it as a zip file either straight from the master branch, or on the release page.

I have previously recommended that you disable the Theming app before installing this theme, that is no longer the case with Nextcloud 14 and onwards. It even seems that, from Nextcloud 14, small styling issue with folder icons are introduced by disabling the Theming app. At the same time, this also enables you to use the Theming app to customize the theme.

Next, git clone or unzip it into your **nextcloud/themes** folder.

To enable the theme, add or change the theme option in your **config.php** to:

    'theme' => 'nextcloud-breeze-dark',

## Contributions
The theme is written with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

Please have a look at the CONTRIBUTING.md for details on how to contribute.
